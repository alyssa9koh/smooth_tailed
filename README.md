- figure out notebook pipeline for calc cluster: what other functions / classes do we need, and how do we organize those modules?

# progress checklist

- get higher accuracies
- get phylo dataset stuff
- re-scope project for anything to submit to bc of impending deadlines

# various notes

1. import all the stuff
2. initialize neural network classes
3. initialize custom dataset class
4. initialize train_pretrain function
5. intialize hyperparameters
6. load in the data and initialize dataloaders
7. set up things for training: model, optimization, etc.
8. actually train epochs
